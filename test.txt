React Doc
if we call the functional component directly , it will not use the 
internal mechanism of react, it returns the react element but if 
look on the type of of element, it is the native tag type,the component will not 
go through the life cycle methods, like mounting face, updating face, unmounting face. 

Build Tools

1) Compiler 
babel compiler transpile the code of jsx in to javascript that will
render on web page. somethinh like jsxDev.createElement
2)Bundling: 
multiple components bundled together is a single js file. 
3)Code Splitting: 
Spliting the diff parts of application asynchronously. 
4) OPtimization: 
1) Dead Code Elimination: 
process of removing the unused code and creating an efficient and small bundle file. 
it is achieved during the build process by tools like 
WebPack, rollup, vite with comnination of tree shaking. 
if any components is not shaking a tree, it is unused and eliminated 
during the builing process.
Image optimization

Dev Server: hot module replacement. 
it will imdiately reflect the changes done in jsx to the web page without 
reloading the page. 

Some common build tools: 
1) WebPack: 
Analyze dependecies and create Graph. 
using plugins to exdent the features like babel-core for transpiling,
code splitting, html files loader. 
HtmlWebpack plugin for generating html files. 


3) Vite: 
uses native ESM(ES modules) and doesn't bundle files during the development
built in support for react, Vue,
uses Rollup under the hood for building the application efficient; 


Dealing with large websites 
if project envolves older libraries that are not suported by 
ESM. 
fine control over each part of build process.
